## Category Theory for the Working Hacker

- Let's learn some powerful domain modeling and programming tools!

## Functors

- Structure preservering

- ```
map :: a -> b -> f a -> f b
```

- Says "Map takes functions that map as to bs and gives us back a function that maps as to bs that are in some structure f"


## (Co)Induction is the same as (Co)Recursion

### Catamorphisms

## Conclusion

- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$
